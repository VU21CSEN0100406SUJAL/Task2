            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                I am Sujal Bansal, currently pursuing my 4th year of B.Tech, with a deep passion for web design and development. 
                I am driven by a love for learning and experimenting with new technologies. My academic journey has provided 
                me with strong conceptual knowledge of web development, including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and back-end technologies 
                like Python and C. 
            </p>
            <p>
                My goal is to craft visually stunning and user-friendly digital experiences. I am constantly improving my skills 
                and working on personal and professional projects to sharpen my abilities.
